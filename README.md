# File Transfer Portal

Born out of necessity, after wireless comms on my laptop failed and I decided to to use it with an auxiliary laptop (the old one alas!).

Web page using Flask and basic python functionalities. Requires hard-coded ip address of enp to be 192.168.1.1 with the other laptop in the same network (not necessary, you can change if required).
